# big-assets

A Leiningen plugin to generate assets with fingerprints for cache busting.

## Version

WIP

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[big-assets "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein big-assets
